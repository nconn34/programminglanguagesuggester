Back-End Programming Language Quiz

Author: Nathan Conn

This is a webpage where a user can learn more about three different languages used in back-end development. After completing a brief quiz, users will have their scores tallied and will be directed to a language that best suits them as an individual.

## Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS
* jQuery-3.6.0
* Bootstrap

## Description

Users will first be guided to a landing page where they will have the option to continue with the quiz or forgo the quiz and be met with a departing vote of confidence. Once on the quiz page, the user will be able to select an option from the dropdown menu that best suits them, and then have their scores counted and a language suggestion generated. The quiz in question was developed at MIT to give a general indication of the overall EQ a person possesses as a sign of which language they may have an aptitude in. 

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Any browser, with a preference for Chrome

* Once on the page, select Yes to continue to the quiz or No to be prompted with some kind parting words.

* While filling out the quiz, be sure to select answers that best represent your interests and closest answer if you could fill anything in the space.

* If you are unsure about your results, you may click the "Reset Form" and try new responses for a different answer.

You will want to clone this from the repository as is!

## Known Bugs

* No bugs known thus far, however with Patrick Osten I was able to help de-bug the clear form command in the javascript, which at first would only clear one selection at a time and not allow the form to be filled out again, to which we realized the .hide() command should go outside of the submit function. Should there be any issues, this would be the most pertinent place to check, specifically line 41 of the scripts.js page.
